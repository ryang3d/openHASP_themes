This is a fork of https://github.com/8bitmcu/openHASP_themes. The intent is to modify the openHASP_mushroom theme for use with a Lanbon L8 which has a smaller screen than what 8bitmcu is using. This readme will be updated as progress is made.

CURRENT LANBON L8 CONVERSION PROGRESS:

-TBA (No changes made... yet. Work is in progress)

# openHASP_theme
In this repository you will find a few themes that work with openHASP. See individual folders for details.

## openHASP_pastel [NOT MODIFIED FOR LANBON L8 YET...]

Is a simple, yet good looking theme that is easy to configure. If you are new to openHASP or haven't configured much yet, this is a good choice to begin with.

## openHASP_mushroom

Is a theme that follows the excellent Mushroom cards. It is of medium difficulty to set up and configure
